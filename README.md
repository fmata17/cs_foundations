# 🧠 CS Foundations  
**A focused learning repository for data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving**

## 📘 Overview
**CS Foundations** is a long-term study project built to deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts.  
It covers algorithmic problem-solving, data structures, and time complexity analysis — implemented in **Python** and **C++**.  

The repository follows my progress through LeetCode and related exercises, focusing on clean, reusable, and well-documented implementations.

## ⚙️ What’s Inside
- Step-by-step solutions to common algorithmic problems  
- Core data structure implementations (Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Hash Maps, etc.)  
- Side-by-side **C++** and **Python** versions for language mastery  
- Essential algorithm templates for sorting, searching, recursion, and dynamic programming  
- Notes and comparisons on **time/space complexity** across approaches  

---

## 🧩 Purpose
This repo is part of my long-term preparation for:
- Technical interviews  
- Algorithmic proficiency  
- Building a stronger foundation for AI and system design work  

Each solution is crafted for readability and clarity — not just correctness — to make the learning process transparent and reproducible.
